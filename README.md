## 🗒️ - Planning & Problem Solving
- Design and render a game of Tic Tac Toe in HTML/CSS and JS. 
- **Switch turns** between more than one player
- **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
- **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
- Use **Javascript** for **DOM manipulation**
- **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
- Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
