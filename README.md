## 🗒️ - Planning & Problem Solving
- Design and render a game of Tic Tac Toe in HTML/CSS and JS. 
- **Switch turns** between more than one player
- **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
- **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
- Use **Javascript** for **DOM manipulation**
- **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
- Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

## 🧰: Tech
---
- Programming languages: JS
- Low tech JS - No use of custome functions. Will use: loops, conditions and array/string methods.

## :scream: Bugs to fix
//Known bug - Clicking on the .gameContainer changes the background - need to turn this feature off. 
// You can click on a square that has already been clicked on and it changes the turn (background stays the same)

## :sob: Lessons learnt
- storing array data in a new variable change the data type and cause problems if not done correctly.
    Storing the choice as a 'var combo' DOES NOT WORK - I think it captures the slice at the start and does not keep it upto date. I have learnt to only use array mutation methods on the array when you are about to acces it. 
- .at() = a very useful method and far less complex than splice and slice.
